# Bing Wallpapaer for Mac
A simple Python script capable of batch-downloading and setting Bing picture of the day as wallpaper on your Mac OS X.

## About
Ever since the switch to Mac, I've kinda been missing [PyBingWallpaper]. So I wrote this script to do pretty much the same thing. 

Microsoft provides an API to get the images. This makes things so much easier compared to my initial idea, which was to scrape the webpage. 

PS: This is only a Python script. What you do with it is entirely up to you.
